TEXTPORT

**IMPORTANT** 
Untested on windows. Check Tools-> error console. Try 
changing the save dir.

Plugin to thunderbird that allows you to export your contact 
information or message bodies to text files. This is enabled
in two menus. The first is the folder level menu. This will
preform the action on evey message in the folder. For larger
folders this can take a long time. I exported 19k message in 
2 hours. The second is in the message panel level. Highlight 
one or more messages to preform the actions on.

Export contacts
This produced a csv file with in the format of 
folder,contact,name,email
Each person was on the From,To,CC and BCC will
have a line in the file. These files are saved
to ~/contacts.

Export messages:
This goes over each message and produces a file 
like 
From:
To:
CC:
BCC:
Subject:
Folder:
___::EMAIL ID::DATE IN MILLSECONDS::___
BODY
___::EMAIL ID::DATE IN MILLSECONDS::___

These files are saved by default in 
~/mail/DATE_email_id.txt

Configurations

There are four settings

1) All emails in one file.
This will produce one file for all the emails selected.
The file name will be the time in seconds of when it was
writen.

2)Save messages to:
The folder where messages should be saved.

3)Save contacts to:
The folder where contacts should be saved.

4) The ejs template. 
Each message is render in an EJS template. http://embeddedjs.com/
The template has access to 
h: This is the header object. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsIMsgDBHdr
body: Is the text of the body
folder_name: A string with a the name or messages-NAME
m: m is iffy. dont use it. 
Default template
From:<%= h.author %>\nTo:<%= h.recipients %>\nCC:<%= h.ccList %>\nBCC:<%= h.bccList %>\nSubject:<%= h.subject %>\nFolder:<%=folder_name%>\n___::<%= h.messageId%>::<%=h.date%>::___\n<%= body %>\n___::<%= h.messageId%>::<%=h.date%>::___\n

When you enter your template you do not need to enter "\n" 
just hit enter.  To use the default template just erase 
everthing in the setting

Example:
Just the body
<%= body %>

Just the contacts (untested)
<% var contacts %>
<% if(h.recipients.length>0){contacts+=h.recipients} %>
<% if(h.author.length>0){contacts+= ","+h.author} %>
<%= contacts %>
